## About This Project

I built this macro tracker to solve a personal problem: I wanted a simple, intuitive way to track my nutrition without the complexity of existing apps. Most fitness apps require manual entry of every ingredient, which is time-consuming and often leads to giving up on tracking altogether.

This project combines my interest in fitness with my passion for building practical, user-friendly applications. The AI chatbot feature was particularly exciting to implement - it allows users to simply type "I had 2 rotis and chana masala" and automatically extracts the nutritional information, making healthy eating tracking actually sustainable.

## Future Plans

I plan to deploy this application to the cloud (likely on platforms like Vercel, Railway, or Render) once the development phase is complete. The goal is to make it publicly accessible so others can benefit from the simplified nutrition tracking experience.

## Features

- **Manual Food Entry**: Add meals with food name, calories, protein, carbs, fat, and date
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Natural language food logging using OpenAI and Nutritionix APIs
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js graphs showing calories and protein over 7 days
- **Maintenance Goals**: Set and track calorie targets
- **Mobile Responsive**: Clean, minimalist UI with Tailwind CSS

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

6. Add your API keys to `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID=your_nutritionix_app_id_here
NUTRITIONIX_APP_KEY=your_nutritionix_app_key_here
```

7. Initialize the database:
```bash
python init_db.py
```

8. Run the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/logs` - Get all food logs (optional date filter)
- `POST /api/logs` - Add a new food log
- `POST /api/chat` - Process chatbot input and return macros
- `DELETE /api/logs/:id` - Delete a food log
- `GET /api/settings/maintenance-calories` - Get maintenance calorie target
- `POST /api/settings/maintenance-calories` - Update maintenance calorie target
- `GET /api/stats/weekly` - Get weekly nutrition statistics

## Usage

1. **Manual Entry**: Use the form to manually add food items with their nutritional information
2. **Chatbot**: Type natural language descriptions like "I had 2 rotis and chana masala" to automatically log meals
3. **View Progress**: Check the charts to see your calorie and protein intake over the last 7 days
4. **Set Goals**: Enter your maintenance calorie target to see it displayed as a reference line

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID=your_nutritionix_app_id_here
NUTRITIONIX_APP_KEY=your_nutritionix_app_key_here
```

Get your API keys from:
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Nutritionix: https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api

## Development

The application uses:
- **Flask** for the REST API backend
- **SQLite** for data persistence
- **React** for the frontend UI
- **Chart.js** for data visualization
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for API communication
- **OpenAI GPT** for natural language processing
- **Nutritionix API** for food database

## Troubleshooting

1. **Backend won't start**: Make sure you have the correct Python version and all dependencies installed
2. **API errors**: Verify your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
3. **Database issues**: Run `python init_db.py` to recreate the database
4. **Frontend won't start**: Ensure Node.js is installed and run `npm install` first
5. **CORS errors**: The backend includes CORS configuration, but ensure both servers are running
